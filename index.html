            <p>
              Norman Foster is an expert architect and engineer known for his
              innovative and sustainable designs. He is the founder and chairman
              of Foster + Partners, an architecture firm with a global
              reputation for delivering high-quality, cutting-edge projects.
              Foster's early works include the Willis Faber and Dumas
              headquarters in Ipswich, and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts
              in Norwich. He came to prominence with the completion of the
              Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in 1986. This building was notable for
              its energy-efficient design, which incorporated a number of
              environmentally friendly features such as natural ventilation,
              solar shading, and a rainwater harvesting system.
